## 🎯 What is AgentForge?

**AgentForge** is like having a team of AI experts that work together to improve your code. Think of it as having four specialized programmers sitting at your desk:

1. **🏗️ Architect** - Analyzes your code structure and suggests improvements
2. **🔧 Implementer** - Actually writes the improved code for you
3. **🧪 Tester** - Creates tests to make sure your code works correctly
4. **🛡️ Security Expert** - Checks for security problems and vulnerabilities

When you paste your code into AgentForge, these four AI agents work together to make your code better, safer, and more efficient.

---

## 🚀 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### Step 1: You Paste Code
- You copy your code from anywhere (VS Code, GitHub, etc.)
- Paste it into the code editor in AgentForge

### Step 2: AI Agents Analyze
- The **Architect** looks at your code structure and finds problems
- The **Implementer** takes those suggestions and writes better code
- The **Tester** creates tests to make sure everything works
- The **Security Expert** checks for security issues

### Step 3: You Get Results
- You see all the improvements suggested
- You can accept the improved code or keep your original
- You get visual diagrams showing your code structure
- You can chat directly with any of the AI agents

## 💻 What Code Can You Paste?

AgentForge works with many programming languages:

### ✅ **JavaScript/TypeScript**
```javascript
function findMax(arr) {
  let max = arr[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) {
      max = arr[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```

### ✅ **Python**
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * calculate_factorial(n-1)
```

### ✅ **React Components**
```jsx
function UserCard({ user }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### ✅ **Any Programming Language**
- Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust
- PHP, Ruby, Swift
- SQL queries
